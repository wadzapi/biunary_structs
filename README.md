# BIUNary structure #

Implementing universal binary structary, that is able to successfully replace different data structures. It realize convienient computational paradigm of binary tree. Under the hood it is using 2 dynamic allocated storages. 1st - for userobjects, 2nd to store stucture elements - tree nodes. Storages using reference counting systems - if nobody link to elements it could be allocated with new element. All structures should be implemented, using binary tree nodes with 2 links (pointers) to another nodes (left and right subtrees) and 1 link to the object.
